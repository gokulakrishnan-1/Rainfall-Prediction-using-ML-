# Overview

This project focuses on predicting rainfall using machine learning techniques. The dataset contains weather-related features such as temperature, humidity, pressure, and wind speed, with the target variable indicating whether it rained ("yes" or "no"). The notebook explores data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis (EDA), and the application of a Random Forest classifier for prediction.
